2. browser go back previous page arrow on clicking, app crashes

3. window.FB.api - undefined due to javascript sdk script fixed
added script file on top in head section of index.html

4. Problem:
Click on login button, and don't login to facebook in the popup, just closing it would redirect to dahsboard.
solution: setstate only if isloggedIn is true and only if isLoggedIn is true, then redirect
